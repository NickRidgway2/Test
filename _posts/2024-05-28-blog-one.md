# First Design

![Design One](/assets/lib/design8.png)

I created this design with the simple idea of having something incredibly basic, and seeing how much it can change, by using the same type of shapes. As a result, this is simply a black background with a white square positioned in the middle.
<pre>
  <code class="p5">
function setup(){
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  strokeWeight(5);
  stroke(255);
}

function draw(){
  background(32);
  square(125, 100, 50, 200);
}
  </code>
</pre>
The code here simply creates a white square at the location given.

<pre>
  <code class="p5">
const minLineWidth = 0;
const maxLineWidth = 100;
let lineWidthChange = 10;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  frameRate(1);
  strokeWeight(2);
  stroke(255);
}

function draw() {
  background(32);

  let lineWidth = random(minLineWidth, maxLineWidth);
  for(let lineY = 0; lineY < height; lineY++){
    lineWidth += random(-lineWidthChange, lineWidthChange);
    lineWidth = constrain(lineWidth, minLineWidth, maxLineWidth);

    line(width / 2 - lineWidth, lineY, width / 2 + lineWidth, lineY);
  }
}
  </code>
</pre>
Starting off, variables are declared including the minLineWidth, maxLineWidth and lineWidthChange. I decided to set the framerate to 1. In addition, line 15 is used to create a line width a random value between the minLineWidth and the maxLineWidth. I then decided to use a for loop to iterate the code. The code on line 17 is used to adjust the lineWidth by a random value.  Finally, the code on line 20 is used to draw a horizontal line centred on the canvas. This design is my favourite out of all four as it is the most well rounded and visually pleasing.

Starting off, I adjusted the frame rate from 60 to 1. This means that it will refresh 60 times per second, rather than 1. Thus, making the lines appear 60 times quicker. I changed the +lineWidthChange to –. Although I’m not completely sure how it worked, it increased the size of the black margins and therefore made the centre white rectangle smaller.

This time, I decided to make the design non-symmetrical. Shifting the white area to the left side. I was able to do this by change the width from being divided by 2 to 50 and the lineY width from 2 to 20 as well. Other than that, everything remained the same.
